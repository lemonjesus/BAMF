# BAMF
BAMF stands for Ben, AJ, Matt, and Tucker. It's a microcontroller archetecture developed for our Computer Architecture class.

## How do I use it?
You probably don't. You need Xilinx ISE, that's a pain to set up... it's probably better if you just don't bother.

## Who designed this?
This (very weird) archetecture was designed by Ben, AJ, Matt, and Tucker. AJ wrote an full-blown assembler for this archetecture that he's really proud of. It's probably in this repo, if it's not, it's [here](https://ada.csse.rose-hulman.edu/granowaj/BAFMAssembler).
